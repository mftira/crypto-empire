# How to Use Crypto for Online Shopping

The ability to spend cryptocurrency directly for everyday purchases is one of the most tangible signs of mainstream adoption. In 2025, the options for using crypto for online shopping have expanded dramatically, with solutions ranging from direct payments to crypto-backed cards. This comprehensive guide will walk you through the various methods of spending your digital assets online, helping you choose the right approach based on your preferences for convenience, privacy, and cost.

## Understanding Your Crypto Shopping Options

### Direct Cryptocurrency Payments

Many online retailers now accept cryptocurrency payments directly:
