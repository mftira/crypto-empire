## Mining Economics and Profitability

### Calculating Profitability

**Essential formulas**:

1. **Daily revenue** = (Your hashrate ÷ Network hashrate) × Block reward × Blocks per day × Coin price

2. **Daily electricity cost** = Power consumption (kW) × 24 hours × Electricity rate ($/kWh)

3. **Daily profit** = Daily revenue - Daily electricity cost

4. **Break-even timeframe** = Hardware cost ÷ Daily profit

**Profitability calculators**:
